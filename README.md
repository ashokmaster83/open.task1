I consider myself a very hardworking, intellectual and inquisitive person with great problem solving skills. I am a calm person by nature and can easily work under a lot of pressure without breaking down. I love to code , read or play football in my free time . My perseverance allows me to constantly succeed even when the chances seems minimal

By contributing to open source I will be able to gain more knowledge and see things through a different developer's perspective . Also putting suggestions as well as performing edits on a public platform will help me boost my confidence
